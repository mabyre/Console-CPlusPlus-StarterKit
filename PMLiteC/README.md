It's a big mess not so evident to make it evoluate but, the aim was to make multiplateform code
so, sources are "inside" the PMLiteC and you should deliver for one or for another plateform.

I wanted to keep this organisation cause I don't have other needs but, if you make some modifications in PMLite depending on the use you make in your Console Project, you should release carefully.

If you add the PMLiteC project in your solution then keep in mind that PMLiteC.lib is deliver in the directory :

ConsoleCPlusPlusStarterKit\PMLiteC\PMLitec\Wrk6\PMLiteC\Debug

If you added 

ConsoleCPlusPlusStarterKit\PMLiteC\inc 

has the included files use in your console you must synchornise with the "inside" .h
